#summary One-sentence summary of this page.

= Introduction =

dicomsender was created as a side project, to be able to easily send test Dicom data to PACS servers.
The typical use case is:
- you select the folder where your datasets are stored
- you select one file or folder
- you select the server and the port where you want to send the data
- you press Send button

Currently the multi-selection of items is not possible. I'm working on it :)

= Configuration =

dicomsender uses two configuration files
- server.txt, listing the servers that may receive the dicom data
- config.txt listing the defaut properties of the application

The two files must be located in the same folder as the jar file.
